Input question id order

The write up requires the output to be in the ascending order of question id. My question is can we assume that the questions will be in order in the input file? Because the questions in the given input file seems are all in ascending order.

Just wondering if any one else had this kind of error before...

I changed the type of passages in the question field to FSArray.
And whenever I try to set this field it would give me this error:

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: type.Question.setPassages(Lorg/apache/uima/jcas/cas/FSArray;)

Though I checked the java file of question in the type package and the setPassages method does exist...
I tried setting this feature in different places, and tried adding a new FSArray feature to Question, but still have the same error.

Just wondering if anybody has met this error before.

Note on PI4

Quick note!

It is not a requirement to implement a new passage ranking technique to achieve a full grade for PI4. However, we encourage you to start exploring a different technique, as in PI7 you will be asked to implement a new technique by applying design patterns and compare multiple ranking strategies.

If you have any further questions, do not hesitate in reaching your TA's.

A little change to the format of your system output

We have noticed that two different passages in the input data come from the same document, ending up having the same question ID and source document ID.  Therefore, we need to require your system to output the original text as well in PI4 in order to differentiate them.  We have changed Section 4.2 in the PI4 writeup for this, so please check it.
