Setting parameters to UIMA components programmatically

This note is a follow-up note about an unanswered question asked in the class this Wednesday.  The question was how one can programmatically set parameters to UIMA components, such as Analysis Engines and Cas Consumer.  For auto-grading purposes, PI3 requires you to do this with CPE in your Main.java.  This is technically feasible with UIMA, but a way to implement it might be not so obvious.  Here are some general hints besides UIMA's guide given in the PI3 writeup:
After setting up parameters in your individual Analysis Engines, you might want to override these parameters in your Aggregate Analysis Engine.After instantiating a CPE, you can access your Collection Reader and Aggregate Analysis Engine from the CPE.UIMA Javadocs tells us that CollectionReader, AnalysisEngine, and CasConsumers are interfaces that inherit from their super-interface ConfigurableResource.  This means that they are able to change configuration parameters after they are instantiated.

UIMA example code

This note suggests that you can refer to some ready-to-use UIMA example code to learn about how to implement Collection Readers, Analysis Engines, and CAS Consumers for PI3.  The UIMA example code here means all code given in the 'uimaj-examples' project introduced at the UIMA tutorial.  'My first UIMA annotator' suggested in our previous post is actually a part of the UIMA example code.  You can find other useful code, such as one of the simplest collection reader FileSystemCollectionReader, and SourceDocumentInformation that we discussed in class this Wednesday.  This post is mainly about CPE configurations, but it also contains a guide on how to install the UIMA example code in your Eclipse.

SUBJECT:[Instr Note] How to configure a CPE
CONTENT:Instructor Jun Araki posted a new Note. Your instructor selected to notify everyone in real time of this post, bypassing user email preferences.

How to configure a CPE

This is a follow-up note about an unanswered question in today's class.  The question was how to configure your CPE with a given CPE descriptor.  There are two legitimate ways to do this: (1) using the CPE Configurator (aka UIMA CPE GUI), and (2) editing the CPE descriptor (*.xml file) directly.  The second approach is explained at this link in detail, which has been already suggested in Section 2.4 of the PI3 writeup.

The first approach suggests using a GUI tool called the CPE Configurator, which may enable you to configure components in your CPE more comfortably and intuitively.  In order to use the CPE Configurator, you need to first do some setups, such as installing plug-ins.  Go through the following documentation for these setups:
UIMA Overview & SDK Setup: 3.1. Installation
You actually need to follow the instructions from 3.1.2 to 3.1.5; you can skip 3.1.1 since you have already installed Eclipse.
UIMA Overview & SDK Setup: 3.2. Setting up Eclipse to view Example Code
At the end, you should be able to launch the CPE Configurator by running 'UIMA CPE GUI.launch' under directory 'run_configuration' in the 'uimaj-examples' project that you imported.  If you see an error message "Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.uima.tools.cpm.CpmFrame", you need to set classpaths in your run configurations.  One way to achieve this is as follows:
Right-click on 'UIMA CPE GUI.launch', and select "Run As" --> "Run Configurations"Select tab "Classpath".Click 'User Entries' to select it in 'Classpath'.Click 'Add External JARs'Select all jar files under %UIMA_HOME%/lib

Updated template project -- corrected cpeDescriptor.xml

We found out that cpeDescriptor.xml in the distributed template project for PI3 had a bug, and could not be loaded by the CPE Configurator, aka UIMA CPE GUI.  We have corrected cpeDescriptor.xml, and updated a link in the PI3 writeup to download the template project, so please use the updated template project.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  The corrected cpeDescriptor.xml should be able to be loaded successfully by the CPE Configurator, exhibiting an empty configuration, which we expect you to start working from.

SUBJECT:Unit 3.02: Module 6 /Multi-Phase, Multi-Strategy Pipelines
CONTENT:Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Unit 3.02: Module 6 /Multi-Phase, Multi-Strategy Pipelines

Just a clarification on the quiz for the Multiple Phases vs Multiple Strategies pipeline module: While the pipeline design terms seem unambiguous, the the options are similar enough to be difficult to match.  The terms are "N-best pipeline", "Best sequential pipeline", and "Multi-phase, multi-strategy pipeline", and the descriptions are below (not necessarily in order):
1. selection of best information objects information objects from all component combinations
2. selection of best information objects from best-performing component combinations
3. selection of best information objects from highest-performing component combination

Ignoring the typo in description 1, it's fairly easy to match this to its appropriate answer choice.  However, the other two choices are a little bit less clear, especially since "best-performing" and "highest-performing" both have superlative meanings.  The wording I might suggest is below, but this is open to discussion!
1. strategy involving ranking selections of information objects based on inputs to give the best combined performance for that input
2. strategy involving selection(s) of information objects to allow for multiple pipelines using the best choice(s) from each phase 
3. strategy involving selection of information objects to give the best overall combined performance for all inputs

Don't leave class early without permission!

Folks,

Two students left class early today. Please plan to spend the whole class period in class, working on your assignments, unless you have prior permission to leave. The next time someone gets up to leave early, I will ask them if they have completed all of their work for the next homework deadline. I will be very unhappy about students who skip class and then expect the TAs to make time for them outside of class.
