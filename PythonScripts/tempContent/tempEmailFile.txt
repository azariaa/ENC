Note on SOLR URI's

Hi guys,In SOLR, you have to use a slightly different address in the application. These addresses shouldn't contain '#'.

In our case:
1. http://ur.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/medline
2. http://metal.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/medline
3. http://gold.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/medline

As a reminder web-interface addresses are:
Team 1 and 2 use http://ur.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/#/medline
Team 3 and 4 use http://metal.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/#/medline
Team 5 and 6 use http://gold.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/#/medline

CONTENT:Your classmate posted a new Question. 

TPZ accepting submissions?

I just ran the t2-submitter-ubuntu.x script, but got the now-familiar error message:
Submission failed, server did not answer back. Please try again later.
Is the TPZ server going to be up and running in time to hand in T2 submissions before the deadline, or should we just email the TAs our submissions?

CONTENT:Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Solr config file?

In trying to run a Solr search, I get this error:

org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.AnalysisEngineProcessException: Annotator processing failed.  at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.callAnalysisComponentProcess(PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.java:401) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.processAndOutputNewCASes(PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.java:308) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.asb.impl.ASB_impl$AggregateCasIterator.processUntilNextOutputCas(ASB_impl.java:570) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.asb.impl.ASB_impl$AggregateCasIterator.<init>(ASB_impl.java:412) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.asb.impl.ASB_impl.process(ASB_impl.java:344) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.processAndOutputNewCASes(AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.java:265) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.AnalysisEngineImplBase.process(AnalysisEngineImplBase.java:269) at org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.engine.ProcessingUnit.processNext(ProcessingUnit.java:893) at org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.engine.ProcessingUnit.run(ProcessingUnit.java:575)Caused by: org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpSolrClient$RemoteSolrException: Error from server at http://gold.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8986/solr/#/medline: Expected mime type application/octet-stream but got text/html. <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"><html>

In googling for an explanation, the only supposed answer I found was that one should specify having a certain request handler in "solrconfig.xml."   Well, we don't have this file, nor "schema.xml," which also seems important.  I tried fetching a couple of default versions of those and putting them somewhere in the build path, but that doesn't seem to have helped the problem.   So I don't know what's up with this.   What's up with this?

SUBJECT:[Instr Note] A clarification on the given training dataset
CONTENT:Instructor Jun Araki posted a new Note. 

A clarification on the given training dataset

We have got a couple of questions about the output format of answers that your QA pipeline is expected to return.   A short answer is that we expect the QA system to output a one-dimensional list of answer items per question.

Here is a long answer.  As you may have noticed in the training dataset, a factoid question has a 1-D array of gold standard answers, whereas a list question has a 2-D array of gold standard answers.  This is because there are many synonyms (semantically equivalent/similar words) in biomedical terminologies, and those synonyms are expanded in those answer arrays.  Given a question, the QA system should return a list of answer items, which will then be compared with the synonym-expanded answer list.  You will formalize details of the comparison in your evaluation component for T3.

Also, please note that your QA pipeline will be expected to output snippets and evaluated with respect to snippets in addition to answers.
