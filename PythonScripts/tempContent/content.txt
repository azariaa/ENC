<p>The Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant is a theme restaurant at Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios, one of the four main theme parks at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida. Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.</p>
<p>The restaurant serves traditional cuisine of the United States. Popcorn functions as a complimentary hors d&#39;oeuvre. Initially, the menu listed items with themed names, such as &#34;Tossed in Space&#34; (garden salad), &#34;The Cheesecake that Ate New York&#34;, and &#34;Attack of the Killer Club Sandwich&#34;, but these playful names were later altered so that they now describe the dishes in a more standard and straightforward manner.</p>
